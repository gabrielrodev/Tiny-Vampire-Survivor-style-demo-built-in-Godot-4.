# Vampire-Survivor-Style Demo (Godot 4)

A tiny arena-survival game built while following  
[GDQuest’s “Your First 2D Game From Zero” tutorial](https://www.gdquest.com/library/first_2d_game_godot4_vampire_survivor/).  
The goal: showcase my ability to read specs, extend code, and ship a playable prototype.
